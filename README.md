-----------------------

- ~~Add "Thoughts" or Blog thingie~~
    - ~~Make the Navigation Image for the page~~

- ~~Add more Buttons to the website~~ Can still be more + Carousel
- ~~Join some web-rings ???~~ Can still be more
- Easier Integration with the "Stats" --> Easier to change etc (maybe a little script)
