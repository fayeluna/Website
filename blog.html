                                <h3>25.09.2025 Yipiee System and stuff</h3>
                                My official gender is already female. I already present as female everywhere. Whether at
                                school, in my private life, in my family, also in public and just in general. And
                                unfortunately, I will never feel like a complete woman because how I was born. And that
                                is also the reason why I will always see myself as not complete and also somewhat
                                invalid.
                                And the sad thing is I am not the only one thinking like that.
                                <br />
                                Because of this ongoing dysphoria and my own self Image of how I see myself and how I
                                always feel, I limit myself and struggle with my private life in my relationship and
                                also just my everyday life.
                                <br />
                                I feel completely alone and in a dead end or in a cage from which I can no longer
                                escape. Because no one wants to or can help me. Since I am not considered as a whole
                                woman by the system, this makes everything even more difficult.
                                I am not taken seriously and am labeled as invalid by the system.
                                <br />

                                <h3>17.09.2025 Feeling alone but atleast CD's are cool</h3>
                                After my therapy session I went into a CD and Vinyl Store. And I think it's really cool
                                and somewhat a really cool experience to just buy a CD and you don't know yet how the
                                Album sounds like.
                                I am very much into Goth music currently (I think so atleast...). And for that genre it
                                didn't have a lot of cd's.
                                <br />
                                Also it was right next to the Punk Section which I also really appreciate since I
                                listened a lot to Punk when I was younger.
                                (not exclusively but I listened to a lot of "Die ärzte").
                                <br />
                                But yea I bought 2 CD's (theoritically 3)
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- Lydia Lunch - Widowspeak (2 CD's)</li>
                                    <li>- Star Trek [Vol.02] --> for my partner yay</li>
                                </ul>

                                I am currently listening to "Lydia Lunch" and so far it's a really cool album so yay me
                                !!!

                                <h3>14.09.2025 Artist Portraits</h3>
                                So the Idea would be to ask and create some portraits of local artists in and around
                                my local Area. For example I would ask some people and maybe take pictures of them when
                                they are practicing. Either in the studio or I could accompany them to a concert etc...

                                <br />
                                <br />

                                It would be basically a win win for both sides since both sides can use those pictures.
                                I can use them in my portfolio and they can use them as Press Pictures or they can use
                                them in their social media etc. etc.

                                <br />
                                <br />

                                This could in theory become a whole series of different local artists. I think
                                <a href="https://stockholm.fotografiska.com/en/exhibitions/anton-corbijn">Corbjin
                                    Exhibition in Sweden</a>
                                inspired me to think about this since the pictures were very very cool and also he did
                                cool covers.
                                And even produced some music videos. Definitly check him out !!!
