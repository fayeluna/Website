    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <a style="color: red;" href="overview.html"><-- Here you can go back to the overview</a>

            <h2>2025/09/17</h2>
            <a>When I updated the site I kinda rushed some stuff. Especially the buttons on the bottom I wasn't 100% happy with how i did it. For example if the page was too small it would just go over the border and that looked really ugly.
                So I tried fixing it and adding 2 rows looks a bit better than the overflowing stuff. So yay me. I am still planning to add different Pictures of different cameras and stuff.
                <br />
                And for that stuff I think I need to create another overview page (I think; not 100% sure how I am going to do it.)
            </a>

            <h2>2025/09/14</h2>
            <a>Finally I "finished" and uploaded the new design on neocities. I added lots of new pages and new Code and
                just it looks different and yea. Also applied to some webrings and added some counters just now and the
                buttons and yaa. If I go look through the site it doesn't feel like I did that much but it took a lot of
                time for me to do this. I think all in all I worked around 2-3 weeks on the new design. I took a lot of
                Inspiration of other sites like
                <a style="color: red;" href="https://incessantpain.neocities.org/">Incessantpain</a>
                and also many other sites. It's pretty time consuming for me to do pretty much anything but I guess I am
                finally happy that the site is in a state that I can upload it and share it with the world.
            </a>

            <h2>2025/09/07</h2>
            <a>I am still kinda figuring out the new design. I changed the overview and just some general stuff. Also
                quickly
                shoot some of the overview pictures such as the books and the about-me. I am quite happy how they came
                out.</a>

            <h2>2025/08/11</h2>
            <a>404 Page Added. The code was provided by my partner and I really like the little conversation you can
                have with
                the chat. It's quite simple but very very cute.</a>

            <h2>2025/08/05</h2>
            <a>Obsessions page added. Where I can just show off what am currently doing. I can just change them to what
                I want
                basically which is quite nice.</a>

            <h2>2025/08/03</h2>
            <a>Gallery Page added. I just uploaded all the drawings I did on procreate and some film Photography. I plan
                to
                uplaod more and also make some more categories. Maybe I could sort them by camera. So if i took a
                picture with
                Camera A. Then make a whole categorie and just show these pictures of the camera. I hope that makes
                sense... Idk
                guess we will see</a>

            <h2>2025/07/25</h2>
            <a>Books added. Just uploaded my reading list and the current book I am reading.</a>

            <h2>2025/07/21</h2>
            <a>Guestbook added. Found a cute guestbook on some other site (I totally forgot the site i originally found
                it on
                oopsie). But yes a guestbook it's quite cute and stuff yay !!!</a>

            <h2>2025/07/19</h2>
            <a>Status addded. Added basically a status page for my energy and inspiration and happiness. Just to gamify
                to check
                how I feel and stuff. Prob would be smart to integrate this a bit better so i can update it easier but I
                have to
                figur out how to do this. Yayyyyy</a>

            <h2>2025/07/07</h2>
            <a>New Website created.</a>
